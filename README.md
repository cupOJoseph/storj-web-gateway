# storj-ipfs-gateway
An IPFS gateway with a storj implementation backend


# Usage of shell script under ./shell

Assume golang (>=1.11) has been setup.

Before do following experiement, backup your local ipfs env.

First, you should run ```./shell/setupStorj.sh```

After that, you should start up storj test network on a new termial by using command  ```storj-sim network run```

Now ```./shell/setupIpfsStorjPlugin.sh``` can be run to setup ipfs-s3c-storj-plugin env.

If all successfully, You should switch to ~/src/github.com/ipfs-s3c-storj-plugin/build and use new built ipfs command. Now you can try ```./ipfs add```, ```./ipfs cat```, ```./ipfs ls```, ```./ipfs get``` etc.  


I have recorded two tty sessiones under ./record directory
To replay these two records, you should install ttyrec, in unbuntu, run following command

```sudo apt-get install ttyrec```

Now
```ttyplay ./record/storjInstallRec``` can replay the storj setup process, during replay, ctrl+'f' can be used to increase playback speed. 

```ttyplay ./record/ipfs-s3c-storj-pluginInstallRec``` can replay the ipfs-s3c-storj plugin setup and some ipfs command test process.
